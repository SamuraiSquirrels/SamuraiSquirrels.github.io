	<h1>Chasing Ayaan: a blog about motherhood and toddlerhood</h1>
	
	<p>I had several child-rearing goals as a first time mom and one was cloth diapering. That's pretty much the only goal I've successfully met.</p>

	<p>This blog is therefore dedicated to tackling every other child-rearing goal I've set out for myself; but most importantly, it'll be about understanding Ayaan's goals as he journeys through his toddler years.</p>

	<p>My first entry will be about trying to create a Montessori/RIE environment in a one-bedroom apartment in the city.</p>
